 Blue Meski
============

The source of the Blue Meski.

The *Source Bleu de Meski" is a desert oasis, at the edge of the
Sahara Desert in southern Morocco.  A delighful and magical place.

Here you will find the source for the blue meski, a collection of
tools for working with the Oasis Loss Model.


Install
=======

On Ubuntu >= 16.10



Requirements
------------

See links for hints on where to get these.

*ktools* 

python >= 3.6

karmapi:  

Plan
====

Use the tools in karmapi to take a look at oasis.

ktools
------

Install this.

It will install a bunch of executables.  These are things like
*gulcalc*, which calculates ground up losses and *eltcalc* which does
something with *event loss tables*, whatever they are.

The next step is to get a model running and then display the inputs
and outputs.

This is just beginning, no release in pypi as yet, nothing much there,
so just checkout the source and look at *git log* to see if anything
is going on here.

karmapi
-------

Best to use the version straight from github.

The code is changing a lot.  Need to do more releases there, since
there is a lot of good newer stuff.

Once *bluemeski* starts to take shape there should be a stable release
series for karmapi.
